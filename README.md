# Mapping_Earthquakes
Build insightful data visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world.  Using the latest earthquake GeoJSON data from the U.S. Geologiical Survey website, you will traverse and retrieve the earthquake data using JavaScript and the D3 and leaflet libraries, and plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request.
